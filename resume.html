              <h2>Software Engineer - Leidos - May 2019 to February 2020</h2>

              <p>
                I started my work at Leidos working on an app called Pathways.
                Pathways helped keep track of patients and their journey through
                the hospital.
                <br /><br />

                Pathways was built utilizing Polymer, HTML, and CSS on the front
                end. The unit testing was done with Sinon, Mocha, and Chai. The
                backend was LEAF (a proprietary framework)/Java, and utilized
                Docker for container management, MongoDB for the database, and
                Kafka/Zookeeper for its messaging system. Build automation was
                handled by Jenkins.
                <br /><br />
                After Pathways, I worked on an application called Command
                Center. We borrowed services from Pathways and extended some of
                the base functionality to create a one stop shop application for
                hospitals. Command Center was developed with similar tooling to
                Pathways except we used React on the front-end and Kubernetes
                for the container system.

              <h2>Web Developer - Quaver Music - Oct 2018 to May 2019</h2>

              <p>
                My time at Quaver was spent writing Dart and Stage XL code to
                complete micro games. I would take assets given to me in
                Illustrator by the art team and create small games utilizing
                gaffs, sprites, sound files, etc. These would be deployed into
                our dev environment and once we tested them fully, they were
                moved to alpha and then eventually production where they were
                embedded into the live site/curriculum.
