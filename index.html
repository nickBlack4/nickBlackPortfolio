            I'm <strong>Nick Black</strong>, a software developer and former
            musician living in Huntsville, Alabama with my wife, four dogs, one cat, and five chickens.

              I have bounced around a few states looking for the right place to settle.  Playing music took me to a few of them and as I transitioned into a career in software development, that led to others.

              I have lived in: Athens, GA • Atlanta, GA • Charleston, SC • Huntsville, AL • Nashville, TN • Morgantown, WV • Charlotte, NC • and now am back in Huntsville, AL to stay (hopefully).  
            </p>

              I've been interested in computers since I was a child. It all
              started with a leftover Tandy from my mom's research/dissertation
              days in a small room that housed the air conditioning ductwork/intake.
            </p>

            <p>
              A state away, my father's bookshelves created a wall of programming
              and math texts. Growing up looking at these titles, I became curious
              to learn more about their content.
            </p>

            <p>
              I tried my hand at college but did not finish. I got close before my
              pop passed but it didn't seem as important after that. While there I changed my major from Math to CS.
            </p>

              After this I played music for a long time working my way through solo sets at three and four hours long to playing in groups with duos, trios, etc.  I learned a lot from doing this and got much better at singing and playing guitar.  When I was living in Nashville I recorded two EPs:  Building the Barn and Watershed.  It was a good experience to play with some incredible players like Pete Abbott and Guthrie Trapp on those sessions.  I learned a lot living there--namely how difficult it was to make a career out of music.  I watched how hard my heroes worked to make ends meet.  I learned that my wife's cousin had gone from washing 18 wheelers to a nice gig at a bank coding.  He did it by going to a six month bootcamp at night after working all day.  This prompted me to look for a similar opportunity and I found the Nashville Software School.  It was a good experience and after roughly four months of being there I took my first job at Quaver Music making web games for children as part of their curriculum.  They were using Dart and an open source framework for graphics called StageXL.  I had a lot of fun there and in many ways I would say it is still the most fun work I've done to date.  However, we wanted to go to the country and see West Virginia and try our hand there.  As such, I chose to leave and go on this pursuit.  In doing that I ended up at my second gig with Leidos.  I worked on the health care side and I was bombarded with so much tech there.  I learned about Docker containers, Kubernetes clusters, back-end programming, etc.  There is so much to list here but the important thing is that it opened my eyes to what it means to be a Software Engineer and not just a web developer.

              It has been interesting to watch the terrain of learning shift. Now
              there are online educators and an abundance of YouTube videos. One
              of my favorites is
              <a href="https://traversymedia.com">Brad Traversy</a>. He is a down
              to earth person with a gift for explaining complicated concepts and
              keeping it fun.  I wish this kind of content existed when I was younger as I can remember being stuck on installing a Borland C++ compiler.  I never did figure it out.

              At this point in time I am positioned to finish my degree at the University of Huntsville in Alabama.  I have one year left.  I'm also working at Millennium Engineering and Integration on an IRAD project.  I'm using Electron JS and as such am able to draw on my previous experience in web development.
