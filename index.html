            I'm <strong>Nick Black</strong>, a software developer and former
            musician. I work full-time in Charlotte, NC and play music on the
            side.
          </p>

          <p>
            If I'm not working, I'm hanging out with my wife and our incredible
            animals.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've been interested in computers since I was a child. It all
            started with a leftover Tandy from my mom's research/dissertation
            days in a small room that housed the air conditioning ductwork.
          </p>

          <p>
            A state away, my father's bookshelves created a wall of programming
            and math texts. Growing up looking at these titles, I became curious
            to learn more about their content.
          </p>

          <p>
            I tried my hand at college but did not finish. I got close before my
            pop passed away but it didn't seem as important after that. I
            studied Computer Science while there.
          </p>

          <p>
            It has been interesting to watch the terrain of learning shift. Now
            there are online educators and an abundance of YouTube videos. One
            of my favorites is
            <a href="https://traversymedia.com">Brad Traversy</a>. He is a down
            to earth person with a gift for explaining complicated concepts and
            keeping it fun.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently I have been concentrating heavily on developing myself in
            this great field.
