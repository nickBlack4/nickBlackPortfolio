                        <p>
                            I moved my music site nickblackguitar.com to a section here as I'm no longer playing for a living.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I started playing professionally in Charleston, SC.  I graduated from open mics to doing three and four hour sets solo acoustic.  This led to playing with others  and expanding to a more electric and band sound.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            We moved out of Charleston and I kept playing in Huntsville, AL.  We went to Nashville from there and played more and recorded two albums, Building The Barn and Watershed.  They are both available on all the regular platforms.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            I transitioned to a career in development while in Nashville and have kept playing gigs but not relying on them wholly for income.
